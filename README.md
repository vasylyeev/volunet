# Volunet

It's an app where you can add your posts, and give them some titles, descriptions, and photos.

## Story

This app is built as part of my personal Flutter Developer portfolio and my bachelor's project. This app shows my skills in:

 1. Usage of different built-in stateless/stateful widgets and making my own custom responsible widgets with fields;
 2. Firebase integration;
 3. Usage of different widgets and models to create a social media app.
 
## Use cases
 
Using this app you can:

 1. Create your own account;
 2. Edit your credentials;
 3. Add/delete/edit posts;
